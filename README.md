## About the project

This is a project aimed at replicating asana (asana.com). Asana is a work management and collaboration platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work.
With this project, I show skills in the following: Reactjs, Nextjs, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Convex, etc. While at it, some concepts/technologies are implemented/used. Notably React's parallel route and intercepting routes; and Redux Toolkit.
